# # Introduction:
# In this code, we will simulate the distribution of sample means by generating random samples from a normal distribution and calculating the mean of each sample. We will then use both analytical and simulation methods to calculate the 95% confidence interval and standard deviation of the sample means and compare the results.

# ## Analytical Methods
# The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. Therefore, we can use the normal distribution to approximate the distribution of sample means and calculate the standard error of the mean (sem).
